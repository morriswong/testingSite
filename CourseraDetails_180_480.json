School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box \u2013 a valuable ability in today\u2019s world.

        "About": "About this course: Popularized by movies such as \"A Beautiful Mind,\" game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call `games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and a few applications.\n\nYou can find a full syllabus and description of the course here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-Syllabus.html \n\nThere is also an advanced follow-up course to this one, for people already familiar with game theory:  https://www.coursera.org/learn/gametheory2/\n\nYou can find an introductory video here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/Intro_Networks.mp4",

        "About": "About this course: We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement. \n\nI hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made \u201cSuccessful Negotiation\u201d one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide.  In the course, you\u2019ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation: \n\n   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy \n\n   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success \n\n   (3) Close: Create a Contract \n\n   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game \n\nTo successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you\u2019ll need to do the following: \n\n(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that \u201cIt\u2019s as good as Breaking Bad.\u201d Another learner compared the course to \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!\n\n(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/ \n\n(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material. \n\nCourse Certificate\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate.

        "About": "About this course: The Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology? \n\nThis course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation \u201cworks\u201d? Would such an understanding validate meditation\u2014or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We\u2019ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn\u2019t exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can meditation make us not just happier, but better people?",

We will examine human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts and behavior.  Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them.   \n\nThe fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without appreciating how interesting they are.  However, we are also routinely influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.  By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding and appreciation of who you are and how you work.

        "About": "About this course: Around the world, we find ourselves facing global epidemics of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and other predominantly diet-related diseases. To address these public health crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead, towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those that threaten it. In addition, we will present a compelling rationale for a return to simple home cooking, an integral part of our efforts to live longer, healthier lives.\n\nView the trailer for the course here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7x1aaZ03xU",

        "About": "About this course: Interest in meditation, mindfulness, and contemplation has grown exponentially in recent years.  Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted in evidence from psychology and neuroscience.  Mindfulness has become the basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness.  For millions around the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.\n\nBut, what actually is mindfulness?  Is it really good for you?  Can anyone learn it?  How can you recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would it smell like sandalwood?  What does it feel like to be mindful?  Are you mindful already, and how would you know?\n\nEvolving from the popular Honours Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed \u2018meditation labs,\u2019 in which you\u2019ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself).  In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.\n\nDuring the production of this course, we have been supported by Willem Kuyken, Director of the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre, and Stephen Batchelor, co-founder of Bodhi College.  And we gratefully acknowledge the contributions made by Mark Williams, co-developer of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Rebecca Crane, Director of the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at the University of Bangor.",

        "About": "About this course: What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?\n\nThis is surely one of life\u2019s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the \"coursera happiness course\" in your email. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (\u201cDr. Happiness\u201d),\n      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren\u2019t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could\u2014or should\u2014be\n      - What are the \u201c7 Deadly Happiness Sins\u201d that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are the \u201c7 Habits of the Highly Happy\u201d and how can you implement them in your life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.",

        "About": "About this course: How to Understand Arguments\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important. This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWhen is someone giving an argument instead of just yelling? Which parts of what they say contribute to the argument? Why are they arguing instead of fighting? What are arguments made of? What forms do they take? Think Again: How to Understand Arguments will answer these questions a more. \n\nIn this course, you will learn what an argument is. The definition of argument will enable students to identify when speakers are giving arguments and when they are not. Next, we will learn how to break an argument into its essential parts, how to put them in order to reveal their connections, and how to fill in gaps in an argument. By the end of this course, students will be better able to understand and appreciate arguments that they and other people present.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 1-5, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.",

        "About": "About this course: This course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary philosophy. Each module a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We\u2019ll begin by trying to understand what philosophy is \u2013 what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we\u2019ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. \n\nTopics you\u2019ll learn about will include: \n\nEpistemology, where we\u2019ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;\n\nPhilosophy of science, where we\u2019ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;\n\nPhilosophy of Mind, where we\u2019ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;\n\nPolitical Philosophy, where we'll investigate whether we have an obligation to obey the law;\n\nMoral Philosophy, where we\u2019ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions \u2013 whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;\n\nMetaphysics, where we\u2019ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about free will and the nature of reality.\n\nThe development of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh's Eidyn research centre.\n\nTo accompany 'Introduction to Philosophy', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Introduction to Philosophy' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind.

Once enrolled you can access the license in the Resources area <<<\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an area of rapid growth and opportunity. Technical innovations in networks, sensors and applications, coupled with the advent of 'smart machines' have resulted in a huge diversity of devices generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs to be processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data, combining it with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved by using connectivity, analytical and cognitive services now available on the cloud, allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n\nThis course is an entry level introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet of Things. It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending the data to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services available. You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution using a popular device, the Raspberry Pi, and a trial version of the cloud-based IBM Watson IoT Platform. \n\nWhat you will learn: \nQuickly create applications that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.  Use Node-RED, an open-source visual application development environment, on both the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging pre-built blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process. Use APIs to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options for various devices, gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure your solution makes best use of the captured data. \n \nWhat technology is required to complete the course?  \nThe programming assignments require you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.  \n\nYou will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform, develop and deploy your IoT solution.\n\nYour Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card.\n\nIn order to setup the Micro SD card, you will need a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.\n\nTo work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable).\nYour Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi\nA USB Keyboard and mouse.\n\nYour Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)\nThere is an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi, a pre-flashed SD card, a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit \n\nWhat prerequisite skills are required ?\nThis is an entry level course, but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT Platform is required.\n\nWhat additional resources do I need for this course? \nThe Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix cloud platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.\n\nWhen your 30-day trial expires, you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix. Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take longer than 30 days to complete the course, or if you have an existing trial account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform to complete the course.",

This course is intended for healthy adults who do not have any chronic disease such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease or any others. In addition, this course does not provide information for people who have food allergies or intolerances.\n\nLosing weight and keeping it off requires planning and goal-setting. Crash diets or fad diets are ineffective and can be dangerous. This course provides evidence-based information for planning a weight loss program that is safe and effective in producing a one to two pound loss per week.\n\nThis course will help learners establish the following: \n\n1. A realistic goal weight with a specific plan for rate of weight loss and time frame for achieving goal weight.\n2. A realistic goal for the frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise that will enable the learner to achieve and maintain the goal weight.\n3. A specific set of strategies for grocery shopping, eating in restaurants, eating at social occasions, and dealing with hunger and emotional eating.\n4. A plan for monitoring food intake, exercise and weight loss.\n5. A plan for continued evaluation of progress to goals and strategies for adjusting goals for continued weight loss for the next 6 months or longer.\n6. A thorough understanding of the difficulty of maintaining weight loss and a plan for maximizing the chances of keeping off the weight lost.",

        "About": "About this course: Medical Neuroscience explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system, while providing a neurobiological framework for understanding human behavior. In this course, you will discover the organization of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation, motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion and related faculties of cognition. The overall goal of this course is to provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany injury, disease or dysfunction in the central nervous system. The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy, as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry) and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit 3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition, and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks 11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.",

The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis.\n\nThis course should be taken after Introduction to Data Science in Python and Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python and before Applied Text Mining in Python and Applied Social Analysis in Python.",

        "About": "About this course: In this course we will seek to \u201cunderstand Einstein,\u201d especially focusing on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a twenty-six year old patent clerk, introduced in his \u201cmiracle year\u201d of 1905. Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the \u201cfourth dimension\u201d? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can\u2019t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn\u2019t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n\nAbout the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the Director of Academic Programs at Stanford University\u2019s Center for Professional Development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science. He holds degrees in physics, mathematics, and the history of science, has published a book and a TED Ed video on \"Young Einstein: From the Doxerl Affair to the Miracle Year,\" and has had over 30,000 students worldwide enroll in his online course on the special theory of relativity (this course!).",

        "About": "About this course: Ever wondered why some things become popular, and other don't? Why some products becomes hits while others flop?  Why some ideas take off while others languish? What are the key ideas behind viral marketing? This course explains how things catch on and helps you apply these ideas to be more effective at marketing your ideas, brands, or products. You'll learn how to make ideas stick, how to increase your influence, how to generate more word of mouth, and how to use the power of social networks to spread information and influence. Drawing on principles from his best-selling book, \"Contagious: Why Things Catch On,\" Professor Jonah Berger illustrates successful strategies for you to use buzz to create virality so that your campaigns become more shareable on social media and elsewhere. By the end of this course, you'll have a better understanding of how to craft contagious content, build stickier messages, and get  any product, idea, or behavior to catch on.",

        "About": "About this course: This course will help you be a better negotiator. Unlike many negotiation courses, we develop a framework for analyzing and shaping negotiations. This framework will allow you to make principled arguments that persuade others. It will allow you to see beneath the surface of apparent conflicts to uncover the underlying interests. You will leave the course better able to predict, interpret, and shape the behavior of those you face in competitive situations.\n\nIn this course, you will have several opportunities to negotiate with other students using case studies based on common situations in business and in life. You can get feedback on your performance and compare what you did to how others approached the same scenario. The cases also provide a setting to discuss a wide-ranging set of topics including preparing for a negotiation, making ultimatums, avoiding regret, expanding the pie, and dealing with someone who has a very different perspective on the world. Advanced topics include negotiating when you have no power, negotiating over email, and the role of gender differences in negotiation. To close out the course, we will hear insights from three negotiation experts: Linda Babcock, Herb Cohen, and John McCall MacBain. Enjoy.",

We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. A notable feature of this course will be an interview module with Emanuel Derman, the renowned ``quant'' and best-selling author of \"My Life as a Quant\". \n\nWe hope that students who complete the course will begin to understand the \"rocket science\" behind financial engineering but perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of skepticism. The follow-on course FE & RM Part II will continue to develop derivatives pricing models but it will also focus on asset allocation and portfolio optimization as well as other applications of financial engineering such as real options, commodity and energy derivatives and algorithmic trading.",

In particular, the Bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty, results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source, freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as explanations of philosophy and interpretation.

        "About": "About this course: Everywhere, every day, everybody uses language. There is no human society, no matter how small or how isolated, which does not employ a language that is rich and diverse. This course introduces you to linguistics, featuring interviews with well-known linguists and with speakers of many different languages. Join us to explore the miracles of human language!\n\nThe Miracles of Human Language introduces you to the many-faceted study of languages, which has amazed humans since the beginning of history. Together with speakers of many other languages around the world, as well as with famous linguists such as Noam Chomsky and Adele Goldberg, you will learn to understand and analyse how your native tongue is at the same time similar and different from many other languages. You will learn the basic concepts of linguistics, get to know some of the key features of big and small languages and get insight into what linguists do.\n\nThis course gives an introduction into the study of languages, the field of linguistics. With the support of the basic linguistic terminology that is offered in the course, you will soon be able to comment both on variety between languages, as well as on a single language\u2019s internal structure. Anyone who wishes to understand how languages work, and how they can give us insight into the human mind is very welcome to join.\n\nThe course is useful if you want to get a fairly quick introduction into linguistics, for instance because you are considering studying it further, or because you are interested in a neighbouring discipline such as psychology, computer science or anthropology. Furthermore, the course will help you develop analytical skills.\n\nIf you are curious to understand how language works and how it gives insight into the human mind, this course is definitely for you!",

        "About": "About this course: This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language \u201cfits together\u201d to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",

These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.\n\nThis means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!",

        "About": "About this course: In this introductory, self-paced course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.\n\nOrganizations are groups whose members coordinate their behaviors in order to accomplish a shared goal. They can be found nearly everywhere in today\u2019s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization\u2019s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization\u2019s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of \u201cseeing\u201d and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations.",

        "About": "About this course: This course deals directly with your ability for creativity which is a critical skill in any field. It focuses on divergent thinking, the ability to develop multiple ideas and concepts to solve problems. Through a series of creativity building exercises, short lectures, and readings, learners develop both an understanding of creativity and increase their own ability.\n\nThis course will help you understand the role of creativity and innovation in your own work and in other disciplines.  It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration.  This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. \n\nThe principal learning activity in the course is a series of \"differents\" where you are challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Beginning with a prompt, e.g. \"eat something different\", you will begin to recognize your own = limits and to overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by it's nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society. In this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. At the same time, these exercises are constrained by concerns of safety, legality, and economics, which are addressed in their creative process.",

        "About": "About this course: We can spend up to a third of our time at work. It is fair to say work is a highly significant part of our lives. How do we find a job that suits us? How do we carry out our work in a productive way? How do we keep ourselves motivated and engaged at work? How can we effectively design work for other people?\n\nIf you have been thinking about at least some of these questions, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to use psychology to understand and improve the work life of yourself and those around you. We will be looking at key topic areas in work psychology that affect people's performance and well-being at work, including: individual differences in personality and cognitive ability; motivation at work; teamwork; leadership; work design and occupational health and safety. Collectively, these topics give you a broad understanding about work psychology both from an individual perspective and from a group-based and organisational perspective.  \n\nEach week, you will meet one or two world-leading professors in the field of work psychology. The professors will take you through the journey by introducing current theories and research evidence in respective topic areas. You will have lots of opportunities to engage in self-reflections and group discussions; you will also be given several self-assessments that help you understand your own psychological attributes and work characteristics.\n\nAn important note so that you are aware of the level of this course. This course is designed for anyone who has interest in Work / Organisational Psychology yet who has NOT completed formal training in Psychology. This is a foundational course that will introduce you to a number of key topics in Work Psychology so that you will understand this area of research and practice, and how you can apply some of the theories and findings into your own work life. This course is NOT designed for people who already have completed substantial formal studies or training in Work Psychology-related areas, such as leadership training. If you have done so, you will likely find this course less suitable for your level, and you might want to consider a more advanced Work Psychology course. \n\nWelcome to Psychology at Work and we wish you all the best in this learning journey!",

We\u2019ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\nThis is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you\u2019ll master the course content more efficiently; you\u2019ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you\u2019ll have a finished project that you\u2019ll be proud to use and share.",

        "About": "About this course: We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \n\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!",

        "About": "About this course: Welcome to Understanding Memory. Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what we can do to enhance it. Based on my recent book \u2013 Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory (MIT Press, 2015) \u2013 I will provide an introduction to the scientific study of human memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold widespread appeal. \n\nTo facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous films to illustrate different aspects of memory \u2013 describing what has been learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background in psychology. Many of us love watching movies because they offer an unparalleled opportunity for entertainment, even if entertaining films are not always scientifically accurate. Still, I believe that we can learn a lot about memory from popular films, if we watch them with an educated eye. Welcome once more. I am looking forward to showing you what movies can teach us about memory.\n\nJohn Seamon\n\nProfessor of Psychology Emeritus\n\nWesleyan University",

        "About": "About this course: The Beginning Game Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!\n\nCaution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.",

        "About": "About this course: Magical thought has always attracted human imagination. In this course we will introduce you to the Middle Ages through a wide conception of magic. Students will have an approach to medieval culture, beliefs and practices from the perspective of History and History of Science. Popular magic, as well as learned magic (alchemy, geomancy and necromancy) will be addressed. Moreover, we will also deal with how eastern practices and texts influenced western culture. In July 2016, the course will contain a brand-new module devoted to astrology. Magic in the Middle Ages offers a captivating overview of medieval society and promotes reflection about certain stereotypes associated with this period.\n\nAt the end of the course, the students:\n\na) will have overcome the usual prejudices about the Middle Ages, \nb) will be able to analyze historical documentation from the Middle Ages and recognize the most common patterns of juridical documents regarding witchcraft, and \nc) will be capable of distinguishing between popular magic and the magic of the learned people; will have a notion of which spiritual practices were allowed in medieval Europe and which ones were related to the devil, and will be aware of the link between a cultural product and the society that produced it.\n\nThis course is taught in English, although subtitles in English, Catalan and Spanish will also be provided.\n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\n\nWeek 1. Introduction to medieval magic (Pau Castell).\n\nWeek 2. Magic & Heresy (Delfi I. Nieto-Isabel).\n\nWeek 3. From Magic to Witchcraft (Pau Castell).\n\nWeek 4.

Concepts are defined briefly and breezily and then applied to many examples drawn from business, the media and everyday life.\n\nWhat kinds of things will you learn?

        "About": "About this course: Organizations large and small are inundated with data about consumer choices. But that wealth of information does not always translate into better decisions. Knowing how to interpret data is the challenge -- and marketers in particular are increasingly expected to use analytics to inform and justify their decisions. \n\nMarketing analytics enables marketers to measure, manage and analyze marketing performance to maximize its effectiveness and optimize return on investment (ROI). Beyond the obvious sales and lead generation applications, marketing analytics can offer profound insights into customer preferences and trends, which can be further utilized for future marketing and business decisions. \n\nThis course gives you the tools to measure brand and customer assets, understand regression analysis, and design experiments as a way to evaluate and optimize marketing campaigns. You'll leave the course with a solid understanding of how to use marketing analytics to predict outcomes and systematically allocate resources.",

        "About": "About this course: In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.\n\nDigital images and videos are everywhere these days \u2013 in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. \n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools \u2013 from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized.",

Understanding your cat and dog\u2019s behaviour and the way they communicate with you, will enable you to better understand their needs and strengthen your relationship with them.\n\nThis MOOC is divided into five topics, the appliance of science; behaviour and body language, senses and perception; challenges for the human-animal relationship, including pet problem behaviour; and how to improve the quality of life for cats and dogs in our care.\n\nAt the start of the course we ask you to consider what you feel is important to your cat/dog and what your cat/dog means to you? We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society? This MOOC explores different scientifically validated methods that can help you to better understand your pet, to enrich their lives and help you to be a more educated and confident pet owner.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the course!",

        "About": "About this course: This is a course on social norms, the rules that glue societies together. It teaches how to diagnose social norms, and how to distinguish them from other social constructs, like customs or conventions. These distinctions are crucial for effective policy interventions aimed to create new, beneficial norms or eliminate harmful ones. The course teaches how to measure social norms and the expectations that support them, and how to decide whether they cause specific behaviors.  The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage, gender violence and sanitation practices. \n\nThis is Part 1 of the Social Norms, Social Change series. In these lectures, I introduce all the basic concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences, that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement is crucial to understanding the nature of the practice you are facing, as well as whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why. In Part 2, we will put into practice all we have learned in Part 1.\n\nNew!

        "About": "About this course: Discrete mathematics forms the mathematical foundation of computer and information science. It is also a fascinating subject in itself.\n\nLearners will become familiar with a broad range of mathematical objects like sets, functions, relations, graphs, that are omnipresent in computer science. Perhaps more importantly, they will reach a certain level of mathematical maturity - being able to  understand formal statements and their proofs; coming up with rigorous proofs themselves; and coming up with interesting results.\n\nThis course attempts to be rigorous without being overly formal. This means, for every concept we introduce we will show at least one interesting and non-trivial result and give a full proof. However, we will do so without too much formal notation, employing examples and figures whenever possible.\n\nThe main topics of this course are (1) sets, functions, relations, (2) enumerative combinatorics, (3) graph theory, (4) network flow and matchings. It does not cover modular arithmetic, algebra, and logic, since these topics have a slightly different flavor and because there are already several courses on Coursera specifically on these topics.",

        "About": "About this course: The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.",

        "About": "About this course: Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of creating a single, general theory of human decision-making. \n\nNeuroeconomics provides biologists, economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions and how others decide. Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\n\nThe course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum. We plan to join the discussions in the forum on a weekly basis.\n\nWelcome to Neuroeconomics World!",

The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new \"genome sequences,\" commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found \"genetic evidence for natural selection.\"  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology (and especially evolutionary genetics).  No prior coursework is assumed.",

        "About": "About this course: Colossal pyramids, imposing temples, golden treasures, enigmatic hieroglyphs, powerful pharaohs, strange gods, and mysterious mummies are features of Ancient Egyptian culture that have fascinated people over the millennia.  The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.\n\nAs the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.\n\nJoin Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.  He has developed this online course and set it in the galleries of the world famous Penn Museum.  He uses many original Egyptian artifacts to illustrate his lectures as he guides students as they make their own discovery of this fascinating culture.",

These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly, though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood. Until now! The five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around the world \u2013 including successes and failures \u2013 through a series of captivating no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too. \n\nWhy? \n\nMore than two generations ago, the venture capital community \u2013 VC\u2019s, business angels, incubators, and others \u2013 convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they\u2019ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. But the vast majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding. Are they onto something that most of today\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem has missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing it faster? Perhaps not. \n\nHow? \n\nYou\u2019ll be asked to do a series of exercises \u2013 out in the real world \u2013 to put your growing toolkit to use in your business or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business start and thrive \u2013 without venture capital. You\u2019ll join our discussion board of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting the tools to work, just as you are. And to suit today\u2019s fast-paced lifestyles, we\u2019ve broken what you\u2019ll get \u2013 short lessons, interviews, thought-provoking questions, even some optional things to read \u2013 into bite-sized chunks, so you can log in and grab them whenever and wherever you are.\n\nAnd what else?\n\nIf, after checking out and perhaps completing this course, you find your company in a position where seeking venture capital turns out to be the right thing to do next, John Mullins leads an inspiring and hands-on executive education course at London Business School \u2013 this one face-to-face \u2013 called Financing the Entrepreneurial Business. There, among a room full of investors and entrepreneurs, you\u2019ll study a series of captivating real-world cases and learn everything an entrepreneur \u2013 or an investor, for that matter \u2013 needs to know to handle the person who sits across the deal table and take an entrepreneurial business from start-up to exit.

        "About": "About this course: This short course surveys all the major topics covered in a full semester MBA level finance course, but with a more intuitive approach on a very high conceptual level.  The goal here is give you a roadmap and framework for how financial professional make decisions.  \n\nWe will cover the basics of financial valuation, the time value of money, compounding returns, and discounting the future.  You will understand discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation and how it compares to other methods.  We also step inside the mind of a corporate financial manager and develop the basic tools of capital budgeting.  We will survey the how, when, and where to spend money, make tradeoffs about investment, growth, dividends, and how to ensure sound fiscal discipline.  Our journey then turns to a Wall Street or capital markets perspective of investments as we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between risk and return.  We then synthesize our discussion of risk with our valuation framework and incorporate it into series of direct applications to practice.\n\nThis course requires no prior familiarity with finance.  Rather, it is intended to be a first step for anyone who is curious about understanding stock markets, valuation, or corporate finance.  We will walk through all of the tools and quantitative analysis together and develop a guide for understanding the seemingly complex decisions that finance professionals make.  \n\nBy the end of the course, you will develop an understanding of the major conceptual levers that push and pull on financial decision making and how they relate to other areas of business.  The course should also serve as a roadmap for where to further your finance education and it would be an excellent introduction of any students contemplating an MBA or Finance concentration, but who has little background in the area.",

In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. \n\nIn this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.

Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach.\n\nIn this first part--part one of five--you will extend your understanding of Taylor series, review limits, learn the *why* behind l'Hopital's rule, and, most importantly, learn a new language for describing growth and decay of functions: the BIG O.",

The course also provides the opportunity to gain experience with the world of VC investments through the use of an exclusive simulator.\n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nThe course is made up of four different modules: \nWEEK 1 - Introduction to Private Equity and Venture Capital\nWEEK 2 - Discovering Private Equity Investors: Legal Issues and Taxation\nWEEK 3 - Management of Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds\nWEEK 4 - Company Valuation And Deal Making In Private Equity Settings\nWEEK 5 - SMARTstart: advanced startup simulator\n\nThroughout the course, guest speakers and practitioners will be interviewed to provide some examples of concrete applications of the contents presented.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND\nAn understanding of the basic concepts of corporate financing accounting principles is required, while prior knowledge of private equity and venture capital is not required however it is recommended, as this is a course designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts in private equity and venture capital.",

This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question\u2014\u201cHow shall I live?\u201d\u2014and his pupil, Plato, and Plato\u2019s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.",

How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call \u201cheuristics\u201d \u2013 rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors \u2013 predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don\u2019t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer\u2019s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices.

We will learn how to construct, fit, assess, and compare Bayesian statistical models to answer scientific questions involving continuous, binary, and count data. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development, explanations of the statistical modeling process, and a few basic modeling techniques commonly used by statisticians.

        "About": "About this course: When do governments deserve our allegiance, and when should they be denied it? \n\nThis course explores the main answers that have been given to this question in the modern West. We start with a survey of the major political theories of the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition. In each case we begin with a look of classical formulations, locating them in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they relate to politics today.\n\nNext we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations. The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for, democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political thinking.\n\nIn addition to exploring theoretical differences among the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging threat of global environmental decay.",

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.",

        "About": "About this course: This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.\n\nThe course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an\nintroductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is\nnatural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not\nformal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a\ncompetent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional\nanalysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the\nmethods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite\nElement Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical\nfoundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner\npresented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,\nalthough the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.\n\nThe development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):\nelliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to\nthe physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in\none dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We\nthen move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and\nmass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems\nin vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next\n(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in\nthree dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to\nquestions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who\nfollowed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical\ndevelopment to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.\n\nBooks:\nThere are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required\ntextbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader\ntreatments than can be provided in any form of class:\n\nThe Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.\nHughes, Dover Publications, 2000.\n\nThe Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals, O.C. Zienkiewicz, R.L. Taylor and\nJ.Z. Zhu, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2005.\n\nA First Course in Finite Elements, J. Fish and T. Belytschko, Wiley, 2007.\n\nResources:\nYou can download the deal.ii library at dealii.org. The lectures include coding tutorials where\nwe list other resources that you can use if you are unable to install deal.ii on your own\ncomputer. You will need cmake to run deal.ii. It is available at cmake.org.",

What makes us intelligent cognitive agents seemingly endowed with consciousness? \n\nThis is the second part of the course 'Philosophy and the Sciences', dedicated to Philosophy of the Cognitive Sciences. Scientific research across the cognitive sciences has raised pressing questions for philosophers. The goal of this course is to introduce you to some of the main areas and topics at the key juncture between philosophy and the cognitive sciences.\nEach week we will introduce you to some of these important questions at the forefront of scientific research. We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions arising from it. Areas you\u2019ll learn about will include:\n\n          Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.\n\n           Philosophy of neurosciences, where we\u2019ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment.\n\n\n Learning objectives\n\nGain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences\n\nUnderstand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the cognitive sciences.\n\nDevelop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\nTo accompany 'Philosophy and the Sciences', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Philosophy and the Sciences' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy and the Sciences team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind. 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone' contains clear and user-friendly chapters, chapter summaries, glossary, study questions, suggestions for further reading and guides to online resources.\n\nPlease note, this companion book is optional - all the resources needed to complete the course are available freely and listed on the course site.",

Analyses of speech and musical databases are consistent with the idea that the chromatic scale (the set of tones used by humans to create music), consonance and dissonance, worldwide preferences for a few dozen scales from the billions that are possible, and the emotions elicited by music in different cultures all stem from the relative similarity of musical tonalities and the characteristics of voiced (tonal) speech. Like the phenomenology of visual perception, these aspects of auditory perception appear to have arisen from the need to contend with sensory stimuli that are inherently unable to specify their physical sources, leading to the evolution of a common strategy to deal with this fundamental challenge.",

        "About": "About this course: General Theory of Relativity or the theory of relativistic gravitation is the one which describes black holes, gravitational waves and expanding Universe. The goal of the course is to introduce you into this theory. The introduction is based on the consideration of many practical generic examples in various scopes of the General Relativity. After the completion of the course you will be able to solve basic standard problems of this theory.  We assume that you are familiar with the Special Theory of Relativity and Classical Electrodynamics. However, as an aid we have recorded several complementary materials which are supposed to help you understand some of the aspects of the Special Theory of Relativity and Classical Electrodynamics and some of the calculational tools that are used in our course. Also as a complementary material we provide the written form of the lectures at the website: https://math.hse.ru/generalrelativity2015",

        "About": "About this course: For many years now, people have been improving their tools, studying the forces of nature and bringing them under control, using the energy of the nature to operate their machines. Last century is noted for the creation of machines which can operate other machines. Nowadays the creation of devices that interact with the physical world is available to anyone. \nOur course consists of a series of practical problems on making things that work independently: they make their own decisions, act, move, communicate with each other and people around, and control other devices. We will demonstrate how to assemble such devices and programme them using the Arduino platform as a basis.\nAfter this course, you will be able to create devices that read the data about the external world with a variety of sensors, receive and forward this data to a PC, the Internet and mobile devices, and control indexing and the movement. The creation of such devices will involve design, the study of their components, the assemblage of circuit boards, coding and diagnostics. Along with the creation of the devices themselves, you will perform visualization on a PC, create a web page that will demonstrate one of your devices, and figure out how an FDM 3D-printer is configured and how it functions.   \nBesides those keen on robotics or looking to broaden their horizons and develop their skills, the course will also be useful to anyone facing the task of home and industrial automation, as well as to anyone engaged in industrial design, advertising and art. \nThe course does not require any special knowledge from the participants and is open even to students of upper secondary school. Programming skills and the level of English allowing to read technical documentation would be an advantage, but this is not obligatory.\nThe entire course is dedicated to practice, so the best way for you would be to get hold of some electronics, follow the illustrated examples and experiment on your own.\n\nThe kits can be purchased here: kits.cyberphysica.ru.\n\nTaught by: Alexey Perepelkin, head of Robotics department in the Laboratory of innovative educational technologies at MIPT\nTaught by: Dmitry Savitsky, researcher in the Laboratory of innovative educational technologies at MIPT",

        "About": "About this course: -- About the Course --\n\nFrom the Nuremberg trial to the case against Saddam Hussein, from the prosecution of Al-Qaeda terrorists to the trial of Somali pirates \u2013 no area of law is as important to world peace and security as international criminal law.  Taught by one of the world\u2019s leading experts in the field, this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international criminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We will examine unique modes of international criminal liability and specialized defenses.  And we will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody of the accused and maintaining control of the courtroom.\n\n-- Course Syllabus --\n\nThis course comprises eight units (or \"modules\"). Each will include an assigned reading, typically an article or book chapter, as well as a simulation designed to bring the readings to life.\n\nI will also offer video lectures on each of the topics, accompanied by slides.  In addition, there will be online role-play exercises and debates, enabling the students to share their own insights. \n\nThe order of class sessions will be:\n\n(1)     History: From Nuremberg to The Hague\n\n(2)     International Crimes Part 1: War Crimes, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, and Torture\n\n(3)     International Crimes Part 2: Terrorism and Piracy\n\n(4)     Special modes of liability: command responsibility, co-perpetration, and incitement\n\n(5)      Special defenses: insanity, obedience to orders, duress, and head of state immunity\n\n(6)      Gaining custody of the accused: extradition, luring, abduction, and targeted killing\n\n(7)      Pre-Trial Issues: plea bargaining, self-representation, and exclusion of torture evidence\n\n(8)      Maintaining control of the courtroom    \n\n-- Recommended Background --\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a lawyer and there are no prerequisites for this course. However, the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable. \n\n-- Suggested Readings --\n\nStudents should read the assigned online materials for each unit in advance of the class session.  \n\nIn addition, students are invited to subscribe to \u201cWar Crimes Prosecution Watch,\u201d a free bi-weekly e-newsletter that summarizes the latest developments in the field of international criminal law.\n\n-- Course Format --\n\nThis course is made up of eight content units. Each unit is based on an online reading assignment, a video lecture of about one hour in length, and one or more role play exercises to stimulate on-line discussion. The course also offers in-video enrichment quizzes (ungraded) for each unit, a ten question multiple choice midterm diagnostics exam (ungraded), and a ten question True/False Final Exam.   \n\n-- FAQ--\n\nHow will this course be graded? \n\nThis course is graded on completion. In order to complete the course each student must: (1) finish each module (or \u201clesson\u201d); (2) write at least one essay response of 200 words or more for at least one simulation throughout the course; and (3) get a score of 6 out of 10 or better on the Final Exam.\n\nWhat resources will I need for this course?\n\nFor this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read and discuss the exciting materials available online.\n\nWhat is the coolest thing about this course?\n\nThe topics we will be discussing are ripped from the headlines.  The topics are often controversial and thought-provoking, and always exciting.",

        "About": "About this course: Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people\u2019s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. \n\nThis course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.",

We will start by introducing the complex plane, along with the algebra and geometry of complex numbers, and then we will make our way via differentiation, integration, complex dynamics, power series representation and Laurent series into territories at the edge of what is known today. Each module consists of five video lectures with embedded quizzes, followed by an electronically graded homework assignment.  Additionally, modules 1, 3, and 5 also contain a peer assessment. \n \nThe homework assignments will require time to think through and practice the concepts discussed in the lectures. In fact, a significant amount of your learning will happen while completing the homework assignments. These assignments are not meant to be completed quickly; rather you'll need paper and pen with you to work through the questions. In total, we expect that the course will take 6-12 hours of work per module, depending on your background.",

What is the right notion of similarity?  Moreover, what if there are millions of other documents?  Each time you want to a retrieve a new document, do you need to search through all other documents?  How do you group similar documents together?  How do you discover new, emerging topics that the documents cover?   \n\nIn this third case study, finding similar documents, you will examine similarity-based algorithms for retrieval.  In this course, you will also examine structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).  You will implement expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.\n   -Identify various similarity metrics for text data.\n   -Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.\n   -Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.\n   -Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.\n   -Cluster documents by topic using k-means.\n   -Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.\n   -Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.\n   -Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).\n   -Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).\n   -Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.\n   -Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python.",

We place cities in the context of sustainable urban transformation and climate change. Sustainable urban transformation refers to structural transformation processes \u2013 multi-dimensional and radical change \u2013 that can effectively direct urban development towards ambitious sustainability and climate goals.\n\nWe will connect the key trends of urbanization, decarbonisation and sustainability. We will examine visions, experiments and innovations in urban areas. We will look at practices (what is happening in cities at present) and opportunities (what are the possibilities for cities going forwards into the future). We bring together a collection of diverse short films and key short readings on sustainable cities as well as interactive forums and a practical assignment to create an online learning community.\n\nThis course provides key examples of activities to promote sustainable cities in Scandinavia, Europe and around the world. We utilize films and reports by WWF, the Economist Intelligence Unit, ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability, UN-Habitat, C40 Climate Leadership Group, Arup, Sustainia, the Rockefeller Foundation, and ongoing research projects. This course is produced by Lund University in cooperation with WWF and ICLEI. It is available for free to everyone, everywhere!\n\nThe International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University is an international centre of excellence on sustainable solutions. The IIIEE is ideally suited to understand and explain the interdisciplinary issues in sustainable cities and greening the economy utilising the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of its international staff. The IIIEE has been researching and teaching on sustainable solutions since the 1990s and it has extensive international networks connecting with a variety of organizations. \n\n5 hours/week\n5 weeks duration\n30 films\n10 teachers",

Topics covered include financial goal setting, saving and investing, budgeting, financial risk, borrowing and credit. Because financial planning is such a personal topic, you will be encouraged to define your own financial goals and objectives while we discuss concepts and provide tools which can be applied in helping you reach those goals.\n\nWithin each module, you will view a combination of traditional lecture style videos along with video vignettes that introduce financial topics for discussion among participants. The video vignettes provide a unique and exciting component to this course. Each vignette introduces a real-world scenario where financial decisions must be made and financial planning concepts can be applied. You will be challenged to think critically about each scenario and decide how you might come to a resolution if ever faced with a similar situation.\n\nFinally, the course also includes material throughout which is focused on career opportunities in financial planning, including video interviews with actual CFP\u00ae professionals and other professionals working in this exciting and growing career area. The final module in the class is devoted to the topic of financial planning as a career.",

        "About": "About this course: Are you an educator? Have you ever wanted to understand more about how to design your class to make better use of educational technology \u2013 whether fully online or in blended contexts? Would you like to learn from those who have extensive practical experience with online technologies? \n\nThe Learning to Teach Online (LTTO) MOOC will help you develop a working understanding of successful online teaching strategies that you can apply in your own practice. The course is based upon the multi award winning open educational resource developed by Dr Simon McIntyre and Karin Watson. \n\nIntegrating online technologies into your teaching can be a challenging prospect, and it can be difficult to know how to approach it effectively for the benefit of both students and yourself. No one knows your own content and teaching strengths better than you, and the \u201cone size fits all\u201d formula doesn\u2019t always suit everyone. No matter what type of technology you are interested in exploring or your level of experience, this course will help you draw on your teaching strengths and find the approach that is right for you, your students and your educational context. \n\nThis course will guide you through your journey of understanding how online technologies can enhance your course design. You will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of effective online teaching practices and their relationship to the use of different technologies. You will also be encouraged to progressively design and reflect upon your own online learning activity, assessment or resource for use in your own class if you choose to undertake the course assignments.",

We will look at the vast world of digital imaging, from how computers and digital cameras form images to how digital special effects are used in Hollywood movies to how the Mars Rover was able to send photographs across millions of miles of space.\n \nThe course starts by looking at how the human visual system works and then teaches you about the engineering, mathematics, and computer science that makes digital images work. You will learn the basic algorithms used for adjusting images, explore JPEG and MPEG standards for encoding and compressing video images, and go on to learn about image segmentation, noise removal and filtering. Finally, we will end with image processing techniques used in medicine.\n \nThis course consists of 7 basic modules and 2 bonus (non-graded) modules. There are optional MATLAB exercises; learners will have access to MATLAB Online for the course duration. Each module is independent, so you can follow your interests.",

        "About": "About this course: How to Reason Deductively\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important. This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nImagine that a friend denies that modus ponens is a valid form of argument. Can you prove that it is valid without using modus ponens itself and thereby assuming that it is valid? If so, how? If not, what does this show about the validity of modus ponens?\n\nHow can phrases like \"and\", \"or\", \"if\", and \"not\" work as \"truth-functional connectives\"?\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to evaluate deductive arguments for validity. In particular, you will learn new ways of representing the information that is contained in the premises of a deductive argument. Using these new representational devices (devices that we call \"truth tables\" and \"Venn diagrams\"), we will be able to apply rules to determine whether or not a particular deductive argument is valid. \n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 6 and 7 by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.",

        "About": "About this course: Why just write poems when you can write better ones? This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.\n\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously \u201cmis-used\u201d) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \n\nWe'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.",

We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course. \n\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic, way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices into \u201cthree vehicles\u201d, three programs of theory and practice supporting the personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (H\u012bnay\u0101na), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mah\u0101y\u0101na), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajray\u0101na), also referred to as \u201cesoteric Buddhism\u201d or \u201cBuddhist tantra\u201d. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the \u201cNatural Vehicle\u201d or \u201cPost Tantra\u201d. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course\u2019s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components: (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice; (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices, principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis; (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv) secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.",

        "About": "About this course: This MOOC teaches you how to program core features and classes from the Java programming language that are used in Android, which is the dominant platform for developing and deploying mobile device apps. \n\nIn particular, this MOOC covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app (such as Java\u2019s various looping constructs and conditional statements), enable access to structured data (such as Java's built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap), group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java's primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  \n\nLearners will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments.",

Unlike other more \"classic\" digital circuits courses, our interest focuses more on the system than on the electronics that support it. This approach will allow us to lay the foundation for the design of complex digital systems.\n\nYou will learn a set of design methodologies and will use a set of (educational-oriented) computer-aided-design tools (CAD) that will allow you not only to design small and medium size circuits, but also to access to higher level courses covering so exciting topics as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) design or computer architecture, to give just two examples.\n\nCourse topics are complemented with the design of a simple processor, introduced as a transversal example of a complex digital system. This example will let you understand and feel comfortable with some fundamental computer architecture terms as the instruction set, microprograms and microinstructions.\n\nAfter completing this course you will be able to:\n\n   * Design medium complexity digital systems.\n   * Understand the description of digital systems using high-level languages such as VHDL.\n   * Understand how computers operate at their most basic level (machine language).",

The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.",
